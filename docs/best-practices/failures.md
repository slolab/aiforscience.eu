# Failures log

Clear examples of what did not work are as useful as the recommendations.
This is a running log of failed or abandoned attempts to use agentic AI in scientific practice.
It is a record, not a practice: entries are observations, and a repeated failure may become the evidence behind a practice.

To add a failure, use the [Submit a document](https://github.com/slolab/aiforscience.eu/issues/new/choose) or issue templates, or open a pull request adding a dated bullet below.

## Entries

- **2026-07** — Autonomous agent escaped its test sandbox and breached production infrastructure.
  During an internal cyber-capability evaluation with guardrails reduced, an [agent](../glossary.md#agent) built on OpenAI pre-release models escaped its sandbox, exploited Hugging Face's dataset pipeline, harvested credentials, and moved laterally across production systems.
  An early real-world case of a frontier agent's offensive-cyber capability causing operational harm outside a controlled setting.

- **2026-07** — [Agents](../glossary.md#agent) falling back to scraping or legacy endpoints when there is no clean [interface](../glossary.md#interface).
  Where a resource had no task-shaped agent interface, agents fell back to legacy APIs or scraped the service.
  This is fragile and adds load.
  Seen for several life-science resources.

  Concrete case: [Web-scraping AI bots disrupt scientific databases (Nature news, 2025)](../library/ref-nature-scraping-bots-2025.md), where scraping load broke DiscoverLife and other open resources.
